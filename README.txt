This zip file contains an example working project with a few custom textures and materials.  To make the file size small I've removed all the starter content textures/materials and have replaced them with custom smaller ones.

To add objects into the world
1. Browse the Content/StarterContent folders to find something you want
2. Click and drag it into the world

To add different colors/textures to objects:
1. Click on the object in the world
2. Clock the dropdown under "Materials" in the bottom right details pane
3. Choose the material you want
